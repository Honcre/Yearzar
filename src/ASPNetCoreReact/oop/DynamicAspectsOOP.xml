The previous chapter focused on modeling the static (organizational) aspects of an OOP solution.
This chapter continues the discussion of UML modeling
techniques and focuses on modeling the dynamic (behavioral) aspects of an OOP solution. 
The focus in this chapter is on how the objects in the system must interact with each other and what activities must
occur to implement the solution.
After reading this chapter, you should be familiar with the following:
• The purpose of scenarios and how they extend the use case models.
• How sequence diagrams model the time-dependent interaction of the objects in
the system.
• How activity diagrams map the flow of activities during application processing.
• The importance of graphical user interface design and how it fits into the objectoriented design process.</panel_attributes><additional_attributes></additional_attributes></element></diagram>
